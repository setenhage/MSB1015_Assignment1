## MSB1015_Assignment1

Welcome to the repository for MSB1015 assignment 1. In this assignment we are going to try to answer the following question: 
<em> "What are drugs targetting genes linkes to rheumatoid arthritis?" </em>

We will be answering this question using WikiData. We will implement a SPARQL query into html code to retreive the information from WikiData. Next, we will be using 3D to visualize our obtained data.
