## MSB1015_Assignment1

Welcome to the repository for MSB1015 assignment 1. In this assignment we are going to try to answer the following question: 
<em> "What are drugs targetting genes linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?" </em>

We will be answering this question using WikiData. We will implement a SPARQL query into HTML to retreive the information from WikiData. Next, we will be using 3D to visualize our obtained data. 

## Pseudocode 
1. Retreive data from WikiData using a SPARQL query implemented in HTML. 
2. Convert the retreived data object into approriate JSON format. 
3. Create Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) using d3. 
4. Implement the SVG into HTML

## Files
wikidata.template.html --> This file is an example query provided by egonw. <br/>
DrugsRheumatoidArthritis --> This file contains the query to find drugs targetting genes linked to RA.
