## MSB1015_Assignment1
Welcome to the repository for MSB1015 assignment 1. In this assignment I have answered the following question: 
<em> "What are drugs targetting genes linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?" </em>

I have answered this question using WikiData. I have implemented a SPARQL query into HTML to retreive the information from WikiData. Next, I have used d3 to visualize our obtained data. 

## Pseudocode 
1. Retreive data from WikiData using a SPARQL query implemented in HTML. 
2. Convert the retreived data object into approriate JSON format. 
3. Create Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) using d3. 
4. Implement the SVG into HTML.

## Files
wikidata.template.html --> This file is an example query provided by egonw. <br/>
DrugsRheumatoidArthritis --> This file contains the query to find drugs targetting genes linked to RA and visualization of this data using a html table and a tree. The file can be run by downloading it to your computer and opening it in a browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.
